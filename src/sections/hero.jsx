            Hello, Iâ€™m Kidus (aka theBitsEngineer), a senior full-stack
            developer based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I graduated with a
            Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering in June 2024 from AASTU,
            and I have over 8 years of programming experience, starting as a
            self-taught developer in high school. I build web apps, mobile apps,
            games, and Telegram bots and more, always with a focus on clean
            code, solid system design, and scalable architecture.
            <br />
            With strong skills in both frontend and backend development, I
            thrive on solving complex problems and delivering reliable,
            high-performance solutions.
          </p>
